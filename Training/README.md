# RochX's USACO Training Solutions
My personal solutions to the various USACO training problems are in this subfolder.

Last modified dates in files are correct, files were only changed in 2021 to obscure personal data, as most if not all of them were part of my high school CS classes.

Programs should work, though a select few may just barely run under time and may need to be submitted to USACO multiple times to get a passing time.

Still a WIP because I need to find all of the correct solutions across multiple computers (I have many that don't work).
